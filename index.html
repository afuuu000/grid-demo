They were very <br> hands-on and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took my <br> learning to the next level in a way that no <br> tutorial ever had. In fact, I’ve often <br> referred to it during interviews as an example <br> of my development experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack developer <br> after receiving multiple offers. 100% <br> recommend!"
